        <h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>300g (about 30) Savoiardi biscuits</li>
            <li>500g of Mascarpone</li>
            <li>4 medium eggs</li>
            <li>100g of granulated sugar</1i>
            <li>2 tablespoons of Amaretto</li>
            <li>cocoa powder</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2><em>Preparation</em></h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>First of all make the coffee. An espresso coffee machine is best but a mokka can be used as well. Add the Amaretto and set it aside.</li>
            <li>Separate the egg white from yolks. Set aside the yolks and whip the egg whites until stiff. If the egg white donâ€™t turn when you turn the bowl over, you got it.</li>
            <li>Now in a bowl, beat the egg yolks with sugar until light and smooth, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, pour the mascarpone cheese into a bowl and work it with a spoon to make it softer. Mascarpone must be of excellent quality, creamy and thick. When the yolks are ready add the mascarpone.</li>
            <li>Slowly whip the mascarpone cream for 2 to 3 minutes. Now add the stiffly beaten egg whites.</li>
            <li>Mix with a wooden spoon, from bottom up. Mix slowly until smooth and creamy</li>
            <li>Now it's time for the savoiardi. Dip the biscuits quickly into the coffee (1-2 seconds max). Then arrange the savoiardi in the casserole.</li>
            <li>Arrange them so that they cover the bottom of the casserole. Then spread the mascarpone cream over the ladyfingers.</li>
            <li>Add another layer of savoiardi and then top with more mascarpone cream. If you are making the last layer, spread the mascarpone generously.</li>
            <li>Finally, sprinkle with cocoa powder. You can even add dark chocolate chips, if you like.</li>
            <li>Let it rest for at least 3 hours before serving.</li>
        </ol>
